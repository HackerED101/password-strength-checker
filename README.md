# Password Strength Checker

A simple Python script to check the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and use of special characters. This tool helps users ensure that their passwords meet security standards and are hard to guess or crack.

## Features
- **Length Check**: Passwords must be a certain length to be considered strong.
- **Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**: Requires a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Special Characters**: Ensures the use of special characters for added security.
- **Digits**: Ensures that the password contains at least one numerical digit.
- **Feedback**: Provides feedback on the strength of the password and tips for improvement.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or higher is recommended)

You can check if you have Python installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

Or for Python 3.x specifically:

python3 --version

Installation

To get started with this password strength checker, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/HackerED101/password-strength-checker.git
cd password-strength-checker

Install Required Dependencies (if any):

If you need any additional Python libraries (for example, re for regular expressions, although it's built-in), you can install them using pip. You may not need additional libraries for this script, but you can set up a virtual environment if needed.

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Usage

To check the strength of a password, simply run the script:

python3 password_checker.py

Sample Output:

Enter your password: MyStr0ngPass!
Password strength: Strong

The script will prompt you to enter a password, and it will provide feedback based on the following criteria:

    Weak: Password is too short, missing characters, etc.
    Medium: Password is decent but can be stronger.
    Strong: Password is strong and meets all criteria.

Example:

    If you enter a password like 12345, the script might return "Weak" because it lacks letters and special characters.
    If you enter a password like MyStr0ngPass!, the script might return "Strong" because it includes a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and a special character.
